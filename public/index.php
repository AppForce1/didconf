           With this conference I am trying to bring together people with experience in iOS development and those aspiring to become experienced iOS developers. I don't care who you are, what your skill level is. I want you to join me for a day of teaching, learning and sharing. Sign up for my newsletter. I will keep you updated on my <a href="https://twitter.com/AppForce1">twitter @AppForce1</a> as well.
